<!-- If we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a separate file.
Script files are attached to HTML with the src attribute: -->
<script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>

<!-- Here, /path/to/script.js is an absolute path to the script from the site root. One can also provide a relative path from the current page. For instance, src="script.js", just like src="./script.js", would mean a file "script.js" in the current folder. -->


<!-- We can give a full URL as well. For instance: -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.js"></script>

<!-- To attach several scripts, use multiple tags: -->
<script src="/js/script1.js"></script>
<script src="/js/script2.js"></script>
