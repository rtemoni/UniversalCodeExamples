<!-- A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists. This would also work: -->
alert('Hello')
alert('World')
<!-- Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This is called an automatic semicolon insertion. In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”!
There are cases when a newline does not mean a semicolon. For example:-->
alert(3 +
1
+ 2);
<!-- The code outputs 6 because JavaScript does not insert semicolons here. It is intuitively obvious that if the line ends with a plus "+", then it is an “incomplete expression”, so a semicolon there would be incorrect. And in this case, that works as intended. -->
<!-- But there are situations where JavaScript “fails” to assume a semicolon where it is really needed.
Errors which occur in such cases are quite hard to find and fix. -->
