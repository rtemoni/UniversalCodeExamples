<!-- A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

To create a variable in JavaScript, use the "let" keyword.

The statement below creates (in other words: declares) a variable with the name “message”: -->
let message;

<!-- Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator "=" : -->
message = 'Hello'; // store the string 'Hello' in the variable named message

<!-- The string is now saved into the memory area associated with the variable. We can access it using the variable name: -->
let message;
message = 'Hello!';

alert(message); // shows the variable content

<!-- To be concise, we can combine the variable declaration and assignment into a single line: -->
let message = 'Hello!'; // define the variable and assign the value

alert(message); // Hello!

<!-- We can also declare multiple variables in one line: -->
let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';

<!-- That might seem shorter, but we don’t recommend it. For the sake of better readability, please use a single line per variable.

The multiline variant is a bit longer, but easier to read: -->
let user = 'John';
let age = 25;
let message = 'Hello';

<!-- Some people also define multiple variables in this multiline style: -->
let user = 'John',
  age = 25,
  message = 'Hello';

<!-- …Or even in the “comma-first” style: -->
let user = 'John'
  , age = 25
  , message = 'Hello';

<!-- We can also declare two variables and copy data from one into the other.   -->
let hello = 'Hello world!';

let message;

// copy 'Hello world' from hello into message
message = hello;

// now two variables hold the same data
alert(hello); // Hello world!
alert(message); // Hello world!

<!-- 
Variable Naming
There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:

The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
The first character must not be a digit. 
When the name contains multiple words, camelCase is commonly used. That is: words go one after another, each word except first starting with a capital letter: myVeryLongName.

What’s interesting – the dollar sign '$' and the underscore '_' can also be used in names. They are regular symbols, just like letters, without any special meaning.

<!-- Variables named apple and APPLE are two different variables. -->

<!-- There is a list of reserved words, which cannot be used as 
variable names because they are used by the language itself. -->
let, class, return, function


<!-- Constants
To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use const instead of let: -->
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';

<!-- Uppercase constants
There is a widespread practice to use constants as aliases for difficult-to-remember values that are known prior to execution.

Such constants are named using capital letters and underscores.

For instance, let’s make constants for colors in so-called “web” (hexadecimal) format: -->
const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
const COLOR_GREEN = "#0F0";
const COLOR_BLUE = "#00F";
const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";

// ...when we need to pick a color
let color = COLOR_ORANGE;
alert(color); // #FF7F00


<!-- Name things right
Some good-to-follow rules are:

Use human-readable names like userName or shoppingCart.
Stay away from abbreviations or short names like a, b, c, unless 
you really know what you’re doing.
Make names maximally descriptive and concise. Examples of bad names are data and value. 
Such names say nothing. It’s only okay to use them if the context of the code makes it 
exceptionally obvious which data or value the variable is referencing.
Agree on terms within your team and in your own mind. If a site visitor is called a 
“user” then we should name related variables currentUser or newUser instead of 
currentVisitor or newManInTown. -->
