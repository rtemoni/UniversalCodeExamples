<!-- Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.
We’ve already seen a statement, alert('Hello, world!'), which shows the message “Hello, world!”.
We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.
For example, here we split “Hello World” into two alerts: -->
alert('Hello'); alert('World');
<!-- Usually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable: -->
alert('Hello');
alert('World');
