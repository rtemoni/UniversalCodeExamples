<!-- Data types
We can put any type in a variable. For example, a variable can at one moment be a string and then store a number: -->
// Dynamic variables
let message = "hello";
message = 123456;

// Number
let n = 123;
n = 12.345;

<!-- The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.

Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.

Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity ∞. It is a special value that’s greater than any number.

We can get it as a result of division by zero: -->
alert( 1 / 0 ); // Infinity

<!-- Or just reference it directly: -->
alert( Infinity ); // Infinity

<!-- NaN represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation, for instance: -->
alert( "not a number" / 2 ); // NaN, such division is erroneous

<!-- NaN is sticky. Any further mathematical operation on NaN returns NaN: -->
alert( NaN + 1 ); // NaN
alert( 3 * NaN ); // NaN
alert( "not a number" / 2 - 1 ); // NaN

<!-- So, if there’s a NaN somewhere in a mathematical expression, it propagates to the whole result (there’s only one exception to that: NaN ** 0 is 1). -->

<!-- BigInt
So to say, all odd integers greater than (253^-1) can’t be stored at all in the “number” type.
A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer: -->

// the "n" at the end means it's a BigInt
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;

<!-- String -->
let str = "Hello";
let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';
let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`;

<!-- In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.

Double quotes: "Hello".
Single quotes: 'Hello'.
Backticks: `Hello`.
Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript.

Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}, for example: -->
let name = "John";

// embed a variable
alert( `Hello, ${name}!` ); // Hello, John!

// embed an expression
alert( `the result is ${1 + 2}` ); // the result is 3
alert( "the result is ${1 + 2}" ); // the result is ${1 + 2} (double quotes do nothing)

<!-- Boolean (logical type) -->
let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked
let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked

let isGreater = 4 > 1;

alert( isGreater ); // true (the comparison result is "yes")

<!-- The “null” value 

It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.

The code above states that age is unknown.-->
let age = null;

<!-- The “undefined” value
The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.

If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined: -->
let age;

alert(age); // shows "undefined"

<!-- Objects and Symbols
The object type is special.

All other types are called “primitive” because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.

Being that important, objects deserve a special treatment. We’ll deal with them later in the chapter Objects, after we learn more about primitives.

The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects. We have to mention it here for the sake of completeness, but also postpone the details till we know objects. -->




<!-- The typeof operator
The typeof operator returns the type of the operand. It’s useful when we want to process values of different types differently or just want to do a quick check.

A call to typeof x returns a string with the type name: -->
typeof undefined // "undefined"

typeof 0 // "number"

typeof 10n // "bigint"

typeof true // "boolean"

typeof "foo" // "string"

typeof Symbol("id") // "symbol"

typeof Math // "object"  (1)

typeof null // "object"  (2)

typeof alert // "function"  (3)
