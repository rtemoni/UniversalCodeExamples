<!-- As time goes on, programs become more and more complex. It becomes necessary to add comments which describe what the code does and why.

Comments can be put into any place of a script. They donâ€™t affect its execution because the engine simply ignores them.

One-line comments start with two forward slash characters //.

The rest of the line is a comment. It may occupy a full line of its own or follow a statement. -->
// This comment occupies a line of its own
alert('Hello');

alert('World'); // This comment follows the statement

/* An example with two messages.
This is a multiline comment.
*/
alert('Hello');
alert('World');
