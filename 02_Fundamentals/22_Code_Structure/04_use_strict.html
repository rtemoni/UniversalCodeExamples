<!-- The directive looks like a string: "use strict" or 'use strict'. When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way. -->
"use strict";

// this code works the modern way

<!-- 1. Please make sure that "use strict" is at the top of your scripts, otherwise strict mode may not be enabled.
2. There is no directive like "no use strict" that reverts the engine to old behavior. Once we enter strict mode, there’s no going back. -->
