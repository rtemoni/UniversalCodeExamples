# JavaScript
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is used to add interactive features to websites. It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world and is supported by all modern web browsers.

## 1. What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to create dynamic web pages. It allows developers to add interactivity to their websites, such as animations, form validation, and dynamic content updates, without having to reload the entire page.

## 2. Why is it called JavaScript?
Originally, JavaScript was called Mocha, then it was renamed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript. The name "JavaScript" was chosen by its creator, Brendan Eich, to capitalize on the popularity of the then-new Java programming language. However, despite the name similarity, JavaScript is a completely different language from Java.

## 3. How do engines work?
JavaScript engines are responsible for parsing and executing JavaScript code. They work by first parsing the code into an abstract syntax tree (AST) and then translating the AST into machine code that can be executed by the computer's processor. The most popular JavaScript engines are V8 (used in Google Chrome and Node.js), SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox), and JavaScriptCore (used in Safari).

## 4. What can in-browser JS do?
JavaScript can do a lot of things in a web browser, including:
- Manipulating the content of web pages (HTML, CSS, etc.)
- Responding to user events (clicks, mouse movements, etc.)
- Making asynchronous requests to servers (using AJAX)
- Storing and retrieving data from the user's device (using the Web Storage API or IndexedDB)
- Creating and manipulating graphics (using the Canvas API or SVG)

## 5. What can't in-browser JS do?
There are some things that JavaScript cannot do in a web browser, such as:
- Accessing files on the user's device (for security reasons)
- Accessing hardware devices (such as printers or scanners)
- Communicating with other domains (unless explicitly allowed by the server through CORS)
- Running in the background (JavaScript execution is paused when the user switches to another tab or application)
